            <p>Boyle’s law is a gas law which states that the <B>pressure exerted by a gas (of a given mass, kept at a constant temperature) is inversely proportional to the volume occupied by it</b>. In other words, the <b>pressure and volume of a gas are inversely proportional to each other</b> as long as the temperature and the quantity of gas are kept constant. Boyle’s law was put forward by the Anglo-Irish chemist Robert Boyle in the year 1662.</div>         


            <div class="Column">(If P is high, V is low and vice versa)
            Examples of Boyle’s Law
            When a filled balloon is squeezed, the volume occupied by the air inside the balloon decreases. This is accompanied by an increase in the pressure exerted by the air on the balloon, as a consequence of Boyle’s law. As the balloon is squeezed further, the increasing pressure eventually pops it. An illustration describing the increase in pressure that accompanies a decrease in the volume of a gas is provided below. </div>

            <p>Gay-Lussac’s law is a gas law which states that the pressure exerted by a gas (of a given mass and kept at a constant volume) varies directly with the absolute temperature of the gas. In other words, the pressure exerted by a gas is proportional to the temperature of the gas when the mass is fixed and the volume is constant. (If P is High, T is high) (directly proportional) Examples: When a pressurized aerosol can (such as a deodorant can or a spray-paint can) is heated, the resulting increase in the pressure exerted by the gases on the container (owing to Gay-Lussac’s law) can result in an explosion. </div>

            <div class="column">This is the reason why many pressurized containers have warning labels stating that the container must be kept away from fire and stored in a cool environment.Another example of Gay-Lussac’s law can be observed in pressure cookers. When the cooker is heated, the pressure exerted by the steam inside the container increases. The high temperature and pressure inside the container cause the food to cook faster.</p></div>

            <a href="charles.html"><h2>Charles' Law</h2></a>
            <p>Charles' law  or the law of volumes  is an ideal gas law that states that the volume and temperature of a fixed amount of gas are proportional at constant pressure. Doubling the temperature of a gas doubles its volume. Halving the temperature of a gas halves its volume. Heres the formula with a provided example: In the example given T stands for temperature while V stands for volume     which and T1 means initial temperature while T2 stands for final temperature while V1 stands for initial volume while V2 sands for final volume </div>

            <div class="column">Examples of Charles' Law in Everyday life: Hot Air Balloons fly based on Charles law This is because heating up the air inside the balloon increases the balloon’s volume. This decreases its density so the balloon rises up in the air to come down chilling the air allows the balloon to  deflate. The Gas becomes more dense and the balloon sinks. </div>

            <p>The combined gas law is the law which combines Charles’s law, Gay-Lussac’s law and Boyle’s Law. It’s an amalgamation of the three previously discovered laws. These laws relate one thermodynamic variable to another holding everything else constant. The interdependence of these variables represents combined gas law which states that the ratio between the product of pressure-volume and temperature of a system remains constant. (basically it’s Boyle’s law divided with T)

            <div class="column">
            What is a real life example of the Combined Gas Law?
            If a balloon is filled with helium on the surface of the earth, it will have a certain pressure, temperature, and volume. If the balloon is let go, it will rise. Further up in the air, the temperature and air pressure begin to drop. As it gets colder, the volume of the balloon will shrink, but as the air gets thinner, the volume will increase. The changes in temperature and pressure will create a new size (volume) for the balloon as it goes up.

            <p>In thermodynamics, Ideal gas law is a well-defined approximation of the behavior of many gases under diverse conditions. Ideal Gas Equation is the combination of empirical laws like Charle’s law, Boyle’s Law, Gay-Lussac’s law, and Avogadro’s law. Ideal Gas Equation is the equation defining the states of the hypothetical gases expressed mathematically by the combinations of empirical and physical constants. It is also called the general gas equation. It can be defined as:
            “The ideal gas law is the equation of state of a hypothetical ideal gas. It is a good approximation of the behaviour of many gases under many conditions, although it has several limitations”. 
            
 
            If the pressure is kPa, ideal gas constant is 8.314J/K⋅mol
            It is defines as: Physical constant relates the average kinetic energy of an ideal gas with temperature. It is expressed in units of energy per temperature increment per mole. Ideal Gas also doesn’t really exist, it is only hypothetical.  It is also stated that at really low densities, all the real gases tend to obey one universal law called ideal gas law. 

            The ideal gas equation has many limitations.
            1)This equation holds well as long as the density is kept low.
            2)This equation is applicable for single gas or even a mixture of multiple gasses where ‘n’ will stand for the total moles of gas particles in the given mixture.

            Application in real life:
            When it's hot outside, we rely on air conditioning systems to keep our homes and offices cool. These systems work by controlling the temperature, pressure, and volume of the air inside. They use the principles of the Ideal Gas Law to do this efficiently, making sure we stay comfortable even on the hottest days.
            Air conditioning systems use compressors to compress the refrigerant gas, increasing its pressure and temperature. The ideal gas law helps engineers predict the changes in pressure, temperature, and volume of the refrigerant gas during compression and expansion processes.

            Meteorologists use the ideal gas law to model the behavior of gases in the atmosphere. By monitoring pressure, temperature, and volume changes, they can make predictions about weather patterns and atmospheric conditions.
            Meteorologists use the ideal gas law to calculate air pressure at different altitudes in the atmosphere. By knowing the temperature, volume, and number of gas molecules in a particular air mass, they can determine the pressure exerted by that air mass. This helps in predicting weather.
