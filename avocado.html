    <h1><center> Example problems to Avogadro's Law</center></h1>

    <center><h3> First Example: 5.00 L of a gas is known to contain 0.965 mol. If the amount of gas is increased to 1.80 mol, what new volume will result (at an unchanged temperature and pressure)?</h3></center>

    <center> <h4>Formula:

(5.00 L) (1.80 mol) = (x) (0.965 mol)

</h4></center>
<br>

    <center><h3> Second Example: A cylinder with a movable piston contains 2.00 g of helium, He, at room temperature. More helium was added to the cylinder and the volume was adjusted so that the gas pressure remained the same. How many grams of helium were added to the cylinder if the volume was changed from 2.00 L to 2.70 L? (The temperature was held constant.) </h3></center>

    <center> <h4>Formula:

1) Convert grams of He to moles:

2.00 g / 4.00 g/mol = 0.500 mol
2) Use Avogadro's Law:

V1 / n1 = V2 / n2
2.00 L / 0.500 mol = 2.70 L / x

x = 0.675 mol

3) Compute grams of He added:

0.675 mol − 0.500 mol = 0.175 mol
(0.175 mol) (4.00 g/mol) = 0.7 grams of He added

</h4></center>
<br>


    <center><h3> Last Example: A flexible container at an initial volume of 5.120 L contains 8.500 mol of gas. More gas is then added to the container until it reaches a final volume of 18.10 L. Assuming the pressure and temperature of the gas remain constant, calculate the number of moles of gas added to the container.</h3></center>

    <center> <h4>Formula:
5.120 L	/8.500 mol	18.10 L/X

x = 30.05 mol <--- total moles, not the moles added

30.05 − 8.500 = 21.55 mol (to four sig figs)</h4></center>
